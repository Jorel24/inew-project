This is my midterm project.
The main work is found here:
"it-next\js\productScript.js" //Angular part
"it-next\index.html" //Angular part lines 38-39, 588-623
"routes\productRoutes.js" //REST
"Sql\database.sql" //Database
.env
app.js //Main file to run
database.js //Database

I used "npm install express mysql2 dotenv path"
Only the homepage was customized for this project.
Angular is used to get the products with their names, images, ratings, and prices.
